Steps followed to develop the API:-

----------------------------------

    👉 Used Model for information, Controller for Mapping, Service for business logics and Repository for Database queries.

    👉 Added the required maven dependency for Sql and Spring with JPA (Java Persistance API).

    👉 Mapped the Models to table using @Entity annotation.

    👉 Used '@RestController' for creating RESTful web services using Spring MVC.

    👉 Used required Annotations for handling HttpRequests like @GetMapping, @PostMapping etc..

    👉 Achieved Dependency Injection via constructor using @Autowired annotation.

    👉 Used 'JpaRepository<>' for connecting database mapping for executing query.

    👉 Used application.properties file for storing the connection URL.

    👉 Used save(), findById(), findAll() methods to get query results.

    👉 Used JPQL for named queries.

    👉 Used "OneToMany" and "ManyToOne" relationships to map the tables by using annotations.
